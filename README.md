 To make a move:
 * Press "p" to move your pawn. It will display the possible moves and you can click on the sqaure you want your pawn to move. 

 * Press "h" to place a horizontal fence. If you still have remaining fences, it will display every possible position. If you click between 2 squares vertically aligned it will place a horizontal fence between them. 

 * Press "v" to place a vertical fence. If you still have remaining fences, it will display every possible position. If you click between 2 squares horizontally aligned it will place a vertical fence between them. 

 To restart the game, press "space" at any point. 

*Note: While not enforced, it is illegal to block off the opposing player from the goal. Fences also only take up 1 square, as opposed to 2 in the original game.
